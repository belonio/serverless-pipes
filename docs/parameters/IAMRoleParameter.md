## Properties

### type

â€¢ **type**: `string`

It defines the type of IAM role required to be generated for the EventBridge Pipes. Two possible values can be there: 
 - shared (creates a single IAM role which is shared among all the pipes created in the application)
 - individual (creates a seperate IAM role per pipe based on the source & target of the pipe)


Note: "shared" type IAM role permits all the possible access to the pipes. So, use it based on the use case in the application.
